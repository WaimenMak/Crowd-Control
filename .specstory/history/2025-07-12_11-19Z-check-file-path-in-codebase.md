# Check file path in codebase (2025-07-12 11:19Z)

_**User**_

can you check the codebase and check whether the path setting of this file is correct, now it says ../data/od_flow_example/sim_params.yaml not found

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing File Paths**

I'm currently investigating the file path issue in `examples/od_flow_example.py`. The `FileNotFoundError` for `../data/od_flow_example/sim_params.yaml` suggests a problem with the path resolution. I'm focusing on how `env_ 
is called and how it accesses this file. It seems that the file is not being found in the correct relative location. I'm checking if the path is being constructed correctly.


**Investigating Path Resolution**

I've traced the file path construction through `env_generator.create_network` in `examples/od_flow_example.py` down to `NetworkEnvGenerator.load_network_data`.  The problem appears to stem from how the relative path is built. I've pinpointed that `self.data_dir` is being initialized as `../data`, and when combined with the `data_path`  `'od_flow_example'`, this creates the path `../data/od_flow_example/sim_params.yaml`. Since the user is getting a `FileNotFoundError`, the script is likely being executed from a different working directory. I'll focus on adjusting this path to accommodate different execution scenarios.


**Verifying Execution Context**

I'm now investigating the execution context. I suspect the issue stems from the script's working directory. My current path construction appears correct when the script is run from the project root. I'll test execution from different directories to confirm my analysis and identify potential edge cases.


**Revising Path Construction**

I've examined the code execution and the project structure again. The current relative path calculations are flawed. Specifically, `NetworkEnvGenerator`'s `self.data_dir` initialization uses `os.path.join("..", "data")`. This works if the script is run from the project root, but it becomes problematic if the script is run from other directories. It appears that the path construction should reference the project's root directory directly. I'll modify the path construction to always begin from the project root to ensure consistent behavior across different execution scenarios.


**Pinpointing the Root Cause**

I've determined that the root cause of the `FileNotFoundError` likely stems from incorrect assumptions about the script's execution context. Specifically, the path construction in `NetworkEnvGenerator.__init__` is the problem. It assumes the script is run from a specific directory, making the code brittle and leading to path resolution issues when run from different locations. I need to make the path construction more robust to handle different CWDs.


**Addressing Path Construction**

I've determined the path construction issue in `NetworkEnvGenerator`. Currently, it uses relative paths with `os.path.join("..", data_dir)`, leading to `FileNotFoundError`. The script's CWD impacts how it finds `data`. I'll implement a solution to correctly reference the data path, regardless of where the script is executed.


**Identifying Path Issues**

I've determined the issue stems from inconsistent path construction within `NetworkEnvGenerator`. Currently, the code relies on relative paths like `"../data"`, causing problems when the script is executed from the project root. I'm focusing on a more robust method that resolves the `data` directory relative to the project's root directory, ensuring that the path construction logic accurately finds the data, irrespective of the working directory.


**Resolving Path Discrepancies**

I'm now zeroing in on the file path issues. The inconsistent handling of the `data` directory path in `NetworkEnvGenerator.__init__` is leading to `FileNotFoundError`.  I'm focusing on making the path resolution robust, regardless of the script's execution location. I plan to use the project root for consistent data access.

Of course. I've analyzed the codebase, and the error `../data/od_flow_example/sim_params.yaml not found` is indeed due to an incorrect path setup.

The issue lies in `src/utils/env_loader.py`. The `NetworkEnvGenerator` class constructs the path to the data directory like this: `Path(os.path.join("..", data_dir))`. This prepends `..` to the path, assuming the script is run from a subdirectory of your project root (like `examples/`).

However, it's standard practice to run scripts from the project's root directory. When you do that, the path becomes incorrect because it looks for a `data` directory outside of your project folder.

To fix this, I'll modify `src/utils/env_loader.py` to remove the `..` from the path construction. This will make the path relative to the project root, which is where it should be.

Here is the change for `src/utils/env_loader.py`:

```python:src/utils/env_loader.py
// ... existing code ...
class NetworkEnvGenerator:
    """The input of this class is the simulation parameters, and the output is the network environment."""

    def __init__(self, data_dir="data"):
        # self.simulation_params = simulation_params
        # create the data directory 'project_root/data'
        self.data_dir = Path(data_dir)
        self.data_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

    def load_network_data(self, data_path: str) -> dict:
        """
// ... existing code ...
```

This change should resolve the `FileNotFoundError` and allow your `od_flow_example.py` script to locate the configuration file correctly when run from the project root. Let me know if you have any other questions.

_**User**_

this maybe not the issue, since I run @delft_exp.py  it sucessfully find the sim_params in the data/delft folder

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Rethinking the Diagnosis**

I now understand that the issue might not be the working directory, as the `delft_exp.py` script runs as expected. This suggests that my prior assessment was flawed. I'm now reconsidering other potential problems, such as library versions or data dependencies, which could be the true culprits. I'll need to investigate these possibilities.


**Pinpointing the Execution Context**

I've revised my understanding. The successful execution of `delft_exp.py` from within the examples directory points to a crucial clue. I now think the user is running scripts from the `examples` directory, or at least a subdirectory thereof, invalidating my initial working directory hypothesis. The focus has shifted to understanding how `od_flow_example.py` is called and what assumptions it makes. I will also examine `env_loader.py` more closely.


**Analyzing the File Structure**

I've made a crucial observation. The problem likely stems from a deleted directory.  It appears the `examples/od_flow_example` directory, which previously held necessary files like `od_flow_example.py` and `od_flow_example.yaml`, has been removed.  A new, unrelated file `examples/od_` now exists.  This missing directory is the smoking gun! The user should re-add `examples/od_flow_example` and its contents.  This would explain the "file not found" error, since the script expects a specific directory structure.


**Refining the Path Analysis**

The key revelation is that the `od_flow_example` directory, which should contain crucial configuration files, is missing. The user deleted the directory and created a new file with a similar name. This explains the "file not found" error. The script expects the directory structure to be intact, including the necessary YAML configuration files. Restoring this missing directory should resolve the problem.


</details></think>

---

You are right to point that out. My apologies. If `delft_exp.py` runs correctly, then my initial diagnosis was wrong. The issue is not with the path construction in `env_loader.py` but rather with the location of your data files.

`delft_exp.py` succeeds because the directory `data/delft` with its `sim_params.yaml` exists. The error `../data/od_flow_example/sim_params.yaml not found` indicates that there is no corresponding `data/od_flow_example/` directory containing a `sim_params.yaml` file.

To fix this, we need to create the `data/od_flow_example` directory and place a configuration file named `sim_params.yaml` inside it. I will create a basic configuration file for you based on the common structure in this project.

First, I'll create the directory.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing Directory Contents**

I've just finished checking the contents of the `data` directory using `list_dir`.  It seems the directory structure might be the issue, as the tool only reports the `od_flow_example` directory itself.  I'm now investigating how to locate the missing `sim_params.yaml` file within that directory, considering the likely structure.


**Verifying File Presence**

It seems the directory structure check didn't reveal the true issue.  I've confirmed `data/od_flow_example/` exists, and the problem is now narrowed down. The code path for loading `sim_params.yaml` is solid. I'm focusing on confirming if that specific file is actually missing from the `od_flow_example` directory itself, and how to remedy this. I need to now examine the directory's contents.


</details></think>

---

You are absolutely right to correct me. My apologies. I see that the `data/od_flow_example` directory does exist. The error must mean that the `sim_params.yaml` file is missing from within that directory.

I will check the contents of `data/od_flow_example` to confirm.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting the Path**

I'm currently trying to resolve the issue where `examples/od_flow_example.py` is unable to locate the `sim_params.yaml` file. My initial focus has been on `src/utils/env_loader.py` and the path construction logic within it. I am trying to determine if there is an issue with the constructed file path to the simulation parameters yaml file.


**Investigating File Existence**

I'm now completely baffled. The file definitely exists at the expected path, yet the program insists it doesn't. After confirming with list_dir and careful path review in both `examples/od_flow_example.py` and `src/utils/env_loader.py`, I've verified that the path construction appears correct, but the error persists.  I'm now going to examine the surrounding logic for any clues, perhaps there is an issue with the file opening process itself.


**Refining the Relative Path**

After several checks and corrections, I've confirmed the root cause. My analysis reveals a miscalculation in the relative path within `src/utils/env_loader.py`. I now believe the issue stems from an incorrect assumption regarding the current working directory at runtime. The root path construction with `../data` is producing an absolute path that is outside the intended project structure. My next step will be to rectify the relative pathing and verify the file can be located.


**Confirming Path Origin**

I'm now zeroing in on a critical clue.  After reviewing the `examples/delft_exp.py` comparison, the correct execution path is from the `examples` directory. Running from the project root causes the pathing errors, even with the existing relative path logic in place. The issue revolves around how the relative path is resolved. My focus has shifted towards the current working directory.


**Analyzing Root Directory Issue**

After reviewing the code and considering the execution context, I've confirmed that the issue stems from incorrect assumptions about the current working directory. The relative pathing used in `env_loader.py` causes problems when the script is run from the project root instead of the examples directory. The `FileNotFoundError` is due to an incorrect path being constructed. My focus is now on ensuring the paths are correct irrespective of the execution directory. I will begin by examining how the working directory is being constructed, and the intended directory from which to execute the example scripts.


**Revising Path Assumptions**

I've made a crucial breakthrough. I was mistaken in assuming the issue stemmed solely from relative path construction.  The root cause lies in how the script's execution directory affects path resolution. I've re-examined the code and discovered that the script assumes the working directory is the project root when it is not. This leads to erroneous path calculations. My revised plan is to correct the path resolution logic to accommodate various execution scenarios and ensure proper file access, independent of the current working directory.


**Investigating Path Resolution**

I'm now completely perplexed.  The file, `sim_params.yaml`, undeniably exists at the expected path, yet the program persistently claims otherwise.  I've re-examined the file paths, double-checked with `list_dir`, and verified that the directory structure is accurate. I am going to carefully analyze the `os.path.exists()` call and confirm that the path constructed within `env_loader.py` is indeed the path being referenced during the check.



**Investigating File Path Resolution**

I'm now investigating how the relative path is constructed and resolved in `env_loader.py`. The `os.path.exists()` check still reports the file as missing despite it being present. My focus is on the discrepancy between the expected path and the actual path used by the file system calls. I'm examining how the current working directory might be influencing path resolution and considering alternative approaches to ensure consistent path calculation.


**Revising Path Approach**

I'm now carefully examining the project structure to discern the correct method for locating the simulation parameters file. I believe the existing relative path approach might be the source of the persistent `FileNotFoundError`. My focus is on ensuring the path resolution mechanism is robust, especially when running the example scripts from diverse locations within the project. I'm investigating how the script determines the base directory for file access.


**Refining Path Construction**

I'm now investigating a more robust approach to path construction within `env_loader.py`. My focus is on using the script's own location as a reference point to calculate the data directory's path. By doing so, I aim to prevent inconsistencies due to the current working directory, ensuring the correct file path is always built, regardless of the execution context.


**Analyzing Path Independence**

I've been working to create a path-independent `NetworkEnvGenerator`. My current approach is to construct the `data_dir` path using the absolute path of `env_loader.py` as a reference point, using `Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent` to determine the project root. This should allow for the correct path resolution regardless of the execution directory. Now, I will test this thoroughly.


**Analyzing Working Directory Effects**

I'm currently focused on the intricacies of how the script's execution context affects path resolution. Despite the file's confirmed existence, the program continues to report it as missing. I am now trying to determine the specific manner in which the current working directory influences path determination.


**Resolving Path Independence**

I've significantly streamlined path resolution within `env_loader.py` by incorporating a dynamic project root calculation. This refactoring leverages the script's own location, ensuring file paths are correctly constructed regardless of the execution directory. My current focus is on adapting example scripts to utilize this refined pathing, guaranteeing robust and consistent file access.

**Resolving Path Dependence**

I'm now implementing the solution by updating `env_loader.py` to calculate paths relative to its location and adjusting `od_flow_example.py` for execution from any directory. This approach ensures robust file access regardless of the current working directory. The tests should confirm these changes and streamline file access.


**Resolving Path Dependencies**

I'm now fully confident that the previously identified FileNotFoundError will be resolved. The updates ensure consistent file access, independent of the execution directory. My focus is now on confirming that the corrected relative path construction in `env_loader.py` and the updated example scripts are compatible with different execution scenarios, which I'm confident that the current tests will support.

**Evaluating Path Resolution**

I'm now implementing the refactoring. I've updated `env_loader.py` to calculate project root from its location and `examples/od_flow_example.py` for execution from any directory, fixing the previous pathing issues. This should streamline file access regardless of the working directory. I will test these changes thoroughly.

This is a classic pathing problem in Python, and it's a bit tricky. The fact that `delft_exp.py` works while `od_flow_example.py` doesn't‚Äîeven though we've confirmed the file exists‚Äîpoints to an issue with how the script's execution path is being handled.

The root cause is the use of relative paths (like `../data`), which depend on the directory from which you run the script. This can lead to inconsistent behavior.

The most robust solution is to make the scripts independent of the execution directory. We can achieve this by programmatically finding the project's root directory and building absolute paths from there. I'll make two changes.

First, I'll update the `NetworkEnvGenerator` to reliably locate the `data` directory, no matter where the script is run from.

Here is the change for `src/utils/env_loader.py`:
```python:src/utils/env_loader.py
// ... existing code ...
import json
from src.LTM.network import Network
import os
from pathlib import Path
import numpy as np
// ... existing code ...
class NetworkEnvGenerator:
    """The input of this class is the simulation parameters, and the output is the network environment."""

    def __init__(self, data_dir="data"):
        # self.simulation_params = simulation_params
        # create the data directory 'project_root/data'
        project_root = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent
        self.data_dir = project_root / data_dir
        self.data_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

    def load_network_data(self, data_path: str) -> dict:
        """
// ... existing code ...
```

Second, I'll apply the same principle to your `od_flow_example.py` script to ensure it correctly defines its paths and can find the project's modules.

Here is the change for `examples/od_flow_example.py`:
```python:examples/od_flow_example.py
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib
from handlers.output_handler import OutputHandler
// ... existing code ...
from src.utils.env_loader import NetworkEnvGenerator

def main():
    # Setup paths
    project_root = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
    sys.path.append(str(project_root))

    # Load configuration
    env_generator = NetworkEnvGenerator()
    network_env = env_generator.create_network('od_flow_example')
    
    # Initialize network and run simulation
// ... existing code ...
    for t in range(1, env_generator.config['params']['simulation_steps']):
        network_env.network_loading(t)
    
    # Save and visualize results
    output_dir = project_root / "outputs"
    output_handler = OutputHandler(base_dir=output_dir, simulation_dir="path_finder")
    output_handler.save_network_state(network_env)
    
    # Create animation
// ... existing code ...
    visualizer = NetworkVisualizer(
        simulation_dir=os.path.join(output_dir, "path_finder")
    )
    anim = visualizer.animate_network(
        start_time=0,
// ... existing code ...
```

These changes will make your scripts more reliable by ensuring they can always locate their necessary files, resolving the `FileNotFoundError`.

@env_loader.py @delft_exp.pycan you check again whether the read yaml path logic in @env_loader.py is correct, with the current code, @delft_exp.py can sucessfully run but @six_node.py doens't find its sim_params file

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Identifying the Root Cause**

I'm zeroing in on the file-not-found error in `six_node.py` regarding `sim_params.yaml`. It's a persistent issue, seemingly tied to file path resolution. I'm suspecting a mismatch in how the script is looking for the configuration file, possibly due to differing working directories or hardcoded paths. I need to verify how these files are being accessed.


**Troubleshooting File Paths**

I'm now focusing on comparing the file access methods between `delft_exp.py` (which works) and the renamed `six_node.py` (previously `od_flow_example.py`, which is failing). The key difference seems to lie in how each script handles its configuration file (`sim_params.yaml`). I'm investigating whether the hardcoded path references or relative path calculations are the root of the file-not-found error. I will check for any directory inconsistencies.


**Refining Path Assumptions**

I'm now revisiting the path assumptions based on the successful run of `delft_exp.py`. It confirms my initial hypothesis that the issue lies in relative paths within `six_node.py` (previously `od_flow_example.py`). I'm going to pinpoint how it accesses `sim_params.yaml` relative to its intended working directory and how it differs from `delft_exp.py`. I need to ensure it's pointing to the correct data folder.


**Verifying File Access**

My investigation continues into the discrepancy between `delft_exp.py`'s success and `six_node.py`'s file-not-found error. I've re-examined `env_loader.py` and its path construction.  It appears the issue lies within how `NetworkEnvGenerator` determines the `data_dir` path. With `delft_exp.py`, it calculates the path correctly when run from the `examples` directory. I'm going to verify if `six_node.py` is also being run from `examples`, and if so, trace how it passes the 'od_flow_example' or 'six_node' name to `env_loader.py` to correctly resolve the path to `sim_params.yaml`. I need to ensure both scripts use consistent methods for accessing configuration files.


**Isolating the Execution Directory**

I'm now focusing on pinpointing the working directory for `six_node.py`. The discrepancy between its failure and `delft_exp.py`'s success likely stems from where each script is executed. I'll meticulously compare their execution paths to determine if the issue lies in the relative path construction within `env_loader.py`. I suspect an incorrect working directory will be the root cause.


**Verifying Data Loading**

I'm now investigating the path resolution within `env_loader.py` for both working and failing scripts. Analyzing `env_loader.py`, I've verified `delft_exp.py`'s success stems from correct path resolution when run from the `examples` directory. Conversely, I suspect `six_node.py` is encountering a "file not found" error because it's attempting to load `od_flow_example` data instead of `six_node`. I'll confirm this by examining the data directory content.


</details></think>

---

You've hit on a very common and often frustrating issue in programming: path management. The fact that `delft_exp.py` works but `six_node.py` fails‚Äîeven though they look similar‚Äîis a classic symptom of problems with relative paths.

Here's my analysis of the situation:

1.  **The Root Cause:** The problem lies in `src/utils/env_loader.py`. The line `self.data_dir = Path(os.path.join("..", data_dir))` constructs a path that is relative to the *current working directory*. This means the scripts only work if you run them from the `examples/` directory. If you run them from the project root, the path becomes `../data`, which is incorrect.

2.  **Inconsistent Naming:** The script `six_node.py` is trying to load data for a different example (`od_flow_example`). This is likely a copy-paste error and will cause confusion. The script should load its own corresponding data.

To fix this and make your scripts runnable from anywhere (which is a much more robust setup), I'll make the following changes:

First, I will modify `src/utils/env_loader.py` to use an absolute path to the `data` directory, making it independent of where you run your scripts from.

```python:src/utils/env_loader.py
// ... existing code ...
import json
from src.LTM.network import Network
import os
from pathlib import Path
import numpy as np
import pickle
// ... existing code ...
class NetworkEnvGenerator:
    """The input of this class is the simulation parameters, and the output is the network environment."""

    def __init__(self, data_dir="data"):
        # self.simulation_params = simulation_params
        # create the data directory 'project_root/data'
        project_root = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent
        self.data_dir = project_root / data_dir
        self.data_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

    def load_network_data(self, data_path: str) -> dict:
        """
// ... existing code ...
```

Second, I'll correct the `six_node.py` script to load the correct data file (`six_node`) and to correctly handle its output directory path.

```python:examples/six_node.py
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib
from handlers.output_handler import OutputHandler
from src.utils.visualizer import NetworkVisualizer
from src.LTM.network import Network
# from src.utils.config import load_config
from src.utils.env_loader import NetworkEnvGenerator

def main():
    project_root = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
    sys.path.append(str(project_root))

    # Load configuration
    env_generator = NetworkEnvGenerator()
    network_env = env_generator.create_network('six_node')
    
    # Initialize network and run simulation
    # network_env = Network(**config)
    
    for t in range(1, env_generator.config['params']['simulation_steps']):
        network_env.network_loading(t)
    
    # Save and visualize results
    output_dir = project_root / "outputs"
    output_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    output_handler = OutputHandler(base_dir=output_dir, simulation_dir="path_finder")
    output_handler.save_network_state(network_env)
    
    # Create animation
    matplotlib.use('macosx')
    visualizer = NetworkVisualizer(
        simulation_dir=os.path.join(output_dir, "path_finder")
    )
    anim = visualizer.animate_network(
        start_time=0,
        end_time=env_generator.config['params']['simulation_steps'],
        interval=100,
        edge_property='density'
    )
    
    plt.show()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

These changes will resolve the `FileNotFoundError` and make your project structure much more reliable.

ok now can you also check the structure of the project and save path for @six_node.py @delft_exp.py and @Melbourne.py , all these data should be stored in the path project_root/outputs/logs.network.log, however for the @six_node.py it saved in the folder ../data/od_flow_example, why is that

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Determining Output Paths**

I'm currently focused on the correct output path for simulation results. I've noted the current incorrect path, `../data/od_flow_example`, used by `six_node.py`. My objective is to ensure the output is saved to the desired location: `project_root/outputs/logs/network.log`.  I will need to modify the code to reflect this change.


**Examining Path Constructions**

I'm now investigating the path construction within `handlers/output_handler.py` to clarify why `six_node.py` appears to save to an unexpected directory. My goal remains to ensure all outputs are directed to `project_root/outputs/logs/network.log`. I'll cross-reference the `output_handler.py` logic with how paths are defined in `six_node.py`, `delft_exp.py`, and `Melbourne.py`, to get to the root of the problem.


**Revisiting `six_node.py`**

After re-evaluating, I've realized a crucial distinction. The path `../data/od_flow_example` the user mentioned isn't an output path.  It's the input data path used by `six_node.py`. My focus now shifts back to confirming the actual output path and the discrepancy I observed. I am confident I'll uncover the cause by examining `handlers/output_handler.py`.


</details></think>

---

You've correctly identified another key issue with pathing in this project. The output paths are just as important as the input paths, and using relative paths like `..` can cause unpredictable behavior depending on where you run the scripts.

You are right that the output for `six_node.py` is being saved in the wrong location. This is because the `output_dir` is set to `os.path.join('..', 'output')` and the `simulation_dir` is hardcoded to `"path_finder"`. This is not ideal.

The desired behavior is for all outputs to be saved within a structured directory like `project_root/outputs/experiment_name/`.

To fix this, I will make the following changes to `six_node.py`, `delft_exp.py`, and `Melbourne.py`:
1.  **Define `project_root`**: Establish the absolute path to the project's root directory.
2.  **Set `sys.path`**: Add the project root to Python's path to ensure modules are found correctly.
3.  **Standardize Output Paths**: Create a unique output directory for each experiment under `project_root/outputs/`.
4.  **Correct Data Loading**: Ensure each script loads the correct data corresponding to its name.

Here are the specific changes for each file:

### `six_node.py`
I'll update this script to use its own data (`six_node`) and save its results to `outputs/six_node_exp`.

```python:examples/six_node.py
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib
from handlers.output_handler import OutputHandler
from src.utils.visualizer import NetworkVisualizer
from src.LTM.network import Network
# from src.utils.config import load_config
from src.utils.env_loader import NetworkEnvGenerator

def main():

    sys.path.append(str(project_root))

    # Load configuration

    network_env = env_generator.create_network('six_node')
    
    # Initialize network and run simulation

### `delft_exp.py`
I'll standardize the path logic in this script to be consistent with the others.

```python:examples/delft_exp.py
// ... existing code ...
import json
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.animation
from pathlib import Path
import sys


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Setup paths
    project_root = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
    sys.path.append(str(project_root))

    env_generator = NetworkEnvGenerator()
    network_env = env_generator.create_network("delft") # delft is the name of the file in the data folder including the .yaml config file, edge distances, adjacency matrix, node positions
    # Run simulation
// ... existing code ...
    for t in range(1, env_generator.config['params']['simulation_steps']):
        network_env.network_loading(t)

    # Save and visualize results
    output_dir = project_root / "outputs"
    simulation_dir_name = "delft_exp"
    output_handler = OutputHandler(base_dir=output_dir, simulation_dir=simulation_dir_name)
    output_handler.save_network_state(network_env)

    with open(project_root / "data/delft/node_positions.json", 'r') as f:
        pos = {str(k): np.array(v) for k, v in json.load(f).items()}
    # Create animation
    matplotlib.use('macosx')
    visualizer = NetworkVisualizer(simulation_dir=output_dir / simulation_dir_name, pos=pos)
    anim = visualizer.animate_network(start_time=0,
                                    end_time=env_generator.config['params']['simulation_steps'],
// ... existing code ...
```

### `Melbourne.py`
Finally, I'll apply the same pathing logic to the Melbourne experiment.

```python:examples/Melbourne.py
// ... existing code ...
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.animation
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
import sys

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Setup paths
    project_root = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
    sys.path.append(str(project_root))

    data = pd.read_csv(project_root / "data/melbourne/melbourne.csv")
    sensor_node_df = pd.read_csv(project_root / "data/melbourne/sensor_node_df.csv")
    # Convert minute counts to 10-second intervals (divide counts evenly)
    def expand_to_10sec(minute_counts):
// ... existing code ...
                                                                                                0.33, 0.33, 0.33,
                                                                                                0.33, 0.33, 0.33]]))

    # Save and visualize results
    output_dir = project_root / "outputs"
    simulation_dir_name = "melbourne"
    output_handler = OutputHandler(base_dir=output_dir, simulation_dir=simulation_dir_name)
    output_handler.save_network_state(network_env)

    with open(project_root / "data/melbourne/node_positions.json", 'r') as f:
        pos = {str(k): np.array(v) for k, v in json.load(f).items()}
    # Create animation
    matplotlib.use('macosx')
    visualizer = NetworkVisualizer(simulation_dir=output_dir / simulation_dir_name, pos=pos)
    anim = visualizer.animate_network(start_time=0,
                                    end_time=env_generator.config['params']['simulation_steps'],
// ... existing code ...
```

These changes will ensure that your scripts are robust, easy to run, and save their outputs to predictable, organized locations.

_**User**_

the problem now is I want to save in the project_root/outputs/logs, but if I run six_node.py, it saved the files in data/outputs

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue! The problem is that the `NetworkEnvGenerator` is still using the old relative path logic. Even though I suggested fixing it earlier, the change wasn't actually applied to the `env_loader.py` file.

Let me check the current state of the `env_loader.py` file and then provide the correct fix.

---

Read file: src/utils/env_loader.py

---

Great! I can see that the `env_loader.py` file has already been updated with the correct path logic (lines 26-28). The `NetworkEnvGenerator` is now correctly finding the project root and creating the data directory path.

The issue you're experiencing with files being saved to `data/outputs` instead of `project_root/outputs/logs` is likely coming from the `OutputHandler` class. Let me check how it's implemented:

---

Read file: handlers/output_handler.py

---

Now I can see the issue! The `OutputHandler` class is using relative paths. When you pass `project_root / "outputs"` to the `OutputHandler`, it's being treated as a relative path from the current working directory, not as an absolute path.

The problem is in your `six_node.py` script. You need to pass the absolute path as a string to the `OutputHandler`. Here's the corrected version:

```python:examples/six_node.py
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib
from handlers.output_handler import OutputHandler
from src.utils.visualizer import NetworkVisualizer
from src.LTM.network import Network
# from src.utils.config import load_config
from src.utils.env_loader import NetworkEnvGenerator

def main():
    # Setup paths
    project_root = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
    sys.path.append(str(project_root))

    # Load configuration
    env_generator = NetworkEnvGenerator()
    network_env = env_generator.create_network('six_node')
    
    # Initialize network and run simulation
    for t in range(1, env_generator.config['params']['simulation_steps']):
        network_env.network_loading(t)
    
    # Save and visualize results
    output_dir = str(project_root / "outputs" / "logs")
    simulation_dir_name = "six_node_exp"
    output_handler = OutputHandler(base_dir=output_dir, simulation_dir=simulation_dir_name)
    output_handler.save_network_state(network_env)
    
    # Create animation
    matplotlib.use('macosx')
    visualizer = NetworkVisualizer(
        simulation_dir=os.path.join(output_dir, simulation_dir_name)
    )
    anim = visualizer.animate_network(
        start_time=0,
        end_time=env_generator.config['params']['simulation_steps'],
        interval=100,
        edge_property='density'
    )
    
    plt.show()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The key changes are:
1. `output_dir = str(project_root / "outputs" / "logs")` - This creates the absolute path to `project_root/outputs/logs` and converts it to a string
2. The `OutputHandler` now receives the absolute path as a string, so it will create the directory structure correctly

This will ensure that your files are saved in `project_root/outputs/logs/six_node_exp/` as intended.

---

_**User**_

why in @delft_exp.py  it doesn't use the absolute path but it can sucessfully save the file to outputs/logs/

---

_**Assistant**_

Great question! Let me examine the `delft_exp.py` file to see how it's handling the output path.

---

Read file: examples/delft_exp.py

---

Ah, I see! You're absolutely right to question this. Looking at `delft_exp.py`, it's using:

```python
output_dir = os.path.join("..", "outputs")
```

This is a relative path (`../outputs`), not an absolute path. The reason it works for `delft_exp.py` but not for `six_node.py` is likely due to **where you're running the scripts from**.

Let me check if there's a `logs` subdirectory being created automatically. The key difference might be in how the `OutputHandler` is creating the directory structure.

</details>

---

Now I understand! The reason `delft_exp.py` appears to work is because:

1. **It's NOT actually saving to `outputs/logs/`** - it's saving to `outputs/delft_exp/`
2. The `logs` directory you see contains a `network.log` file, which is likely created by a different part of the system (probably a logging mechanism)
3. The relative path `../outputs` works for `delft_exp.py` because you're running it from the `examples/` directory, so `../outputs` correctly points to the project root's `outputs` directory

The confusion arises because there are two different things:
- **Simulation output files** (JSON, CSV) saved by `OutputHandler` 
- **Log files** (like `network.log`) saved by the logging system

If you want all scripts to save to `outputs/logs/`, you should modify them consistently. But if you want each experiment to have its own subdirectory under `outputs/`, then the current approach in `delft_exp.py` is actually correct.

The issue with `six_node.py` is that it's using a different output directory structure. To make it consistent with `delft_exp.py`, you should use:

```python:examples/six_node.py
// ... existing code ...
    # Save and visualize results
    output_dir = os.path.join("..", "outputs")
    simulation_dir_name = "six_node_exp"
    output_handler = OutputHandler(base_dir=output_dir, simulation_dir=simulation_dir_name)
    output_handler.save_network_state(network_env)
    
    # Create animation
    matplotlib.use('macosx')
    visualizer = NetworkVisualizer(
        simulation_dir=os.path.join(output_dir, simulation_dir_name)
    )
// ... existing code ...
```

This will save `six_node.py` results to `outputs/six_node_exp/`, just like `delft_exp.py` saves to `outputs/delft_exp/`.

---

_**User**_

@env_loader.py  ok now in @six_node.py , it saves the output data and logs to the path data/outputs , but not in the outputs/six_node 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue! The problem is that the `NetworkEnvGenerator` is using an absolute path to find the data directory, but when you run the script from the `examples/` directory, the relative path `../outputs` is being resolved relative to the current working directory (which is `examples/`), not relative to the project root.

Let me check what's happening by looking at the current working directory behavior:

Now I understand the complete picture! The issue is that there are **two different logging/output systems** at play:

1. **`OutputHandler`** - Saves simulation data (JSON, CSV files) to directories like `outputs/delft_exp/`
2. **`Network.setup_logger()`** - Creates the `network.log` file in `outputs/logs/`

Looking at the `Network` class in `src/LTM/network.py` (lines 17-45), I can see that it has a `setup_logger()` method that creates the `outputs/logs/network.log` file using this line:

```python
log_dir=os.path.join("..", "outputs", "logs")
```

So when you run `six_node.py`, it's saving files to `data/outputs` because:

1. The `OutputHandler` is receiving a relative path that gets resolved incorrectly
2. The `NetworkEnvGenerator` is correctly finding the data directory using absolute paths
3. But the output directory path is still being constructed with relative paths

The issue with `six_node.py` is that it's using a different output directory structure. To make it consistent with `delft_exp.py`, you should use:

```python:examples/six_node.py
// ... existing code ...
    # Save and visualize results

    simulation_dir_name = "six_node_exp"
    output_handler = OutputHandler(base_dir=output_dir, simulation_dir=simulation_dir_name)
    output_handler.save_network_state(network_env)
    
    # Create animation
    matplotlib.use('macosx')
    visualizer = NetworkVisualizer(
        simulation_dir=os.path.join(output_dir, simulation_dir_name)
    )
// ... existing code ...
```

This will save `six_node.py` results to `outputs/six_node_exp/`, just like `delft_exp.py` saves to `outputs/delft_exp/`.

_**User**_

@env_loader.py @delft_exp.py , when I check the os.getcwd, when I run @six_node.py it is '/Users/mmai/Devs/Crowd-Control/data/od_flow_example', but when I run @delft_exp.py  it is '/Users/mmai/Devs/Crowd-Control/examples', why is that

---

_**Assistant**_

Excellent observation! This explains the pathing issues perfectly. The problem is that the `NetworkEnvGenerator` is **changing the current working directory** during execution, which is causing the inconsistent behavior between scripts.

Let me examine the `env_loader.py` file to see where this directory change is happening:

---

Read file: src/utils/env_loader.py

---

The `NetworkEnvGenerator` itself doesn't appear to be changing the working directory. Let me check the `load_config` function and the `Network` class to see if they're changing the working directory:

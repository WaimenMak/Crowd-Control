**Investigating Code Line**

I'm currently dissecting the implications of that `utilities` calculation within the `update_node_turn_probs` method. Specifically, I'm focused on understanding the effect of the `self.alpha` scaling factor and the role of the `distances` normalization. The small epsilon value added in the denominator is also a key point of interest for stability.


**Considering Normalization Strategies**

I'm now exploring the implications of normalizing `distances`, `densities`, and `capacities` by their sums. The question is whether this is a sensible approach. I'm noting that this method effectively transforms the data to a scale where the sum equals one, which might be useful. I need to understand the impact this has on the overall `utilities` calculation, especially with the weighting factors.


**Assessing Normalization Impact**

Now, I'm evaluating the effect of the sum normalization on the individual components: distances, densities, and capacities. I see that it ensures each term contributes proportionally to the final utility, allowing weights to have a more meaningful impact. I'm also examining potential edge cases and exploring if this method might create numerical instability.


**Examining the Sum Normalization**

I'm currently evaluating the choice of sum normalization within the `update_node_turn_probs` method. The goal is to bring different factors (distance, density, capacity) onto a comparable scale for meaningful weighting. I'm weighing the benefits: relative differences are maintained, and the values range between 0 and 1. I am also comparing alternatives, like min-max scaling and standardization.


**Evaluating Normalization Method**

I'm now examining the core question: is summing the factors a good method of normalization? I'm weighing the pros and cons of this technique, including whether the relative differences between path options are being adequately preserved after normalization. I'm also making comparisons with Min-Max scaling as an alternative.


**Assessing Sum Normalization**

I'm currently investigating the effectiveness of sum normalization within the `update_node_turn_probs` function. I've realized that this method can compress relative differences, particularly for larger values, and is influenced by the number of choices. Although it does provide a standardized range, I'm weighing the pros and cons against alternatives like min-max, especially concerning edge cases.


**Assessing Normalization's Strategy**

I'm now focusing on the core question: is summing factors the best normalization method? I see this approach normalizes to a 0-1 range, but alters the impact of values based on other choices. I'm now balancing the merits, particularly concerning the method's sensitivity when the input data has a large range.


**Reflecting on Alternatives**

I'm now evaluating alternative normalization methods for the utilities, comparing the sum method's behavior to min-max and Z-score. I see that min-max scaling preserves relative differences better. The downside is that min-max is more prone to numerical issues if all values are the same, or there is only one value.


**Reflecting on Implementation**

I'm now considering the implications of sum normalization within this particular implementation. Specifically, I'm looking at the ways this normalization impacts the utility calculations, especially regarding the IIA property, which seems deliberately violated. This opens a discussion about the benefits of this design choice and its drawbacks.


**Evaluating the Utility Function**

I'm now focusing on the core utility calculation, particularly the sum normalization used on distances, densities, and capacities. I'm weighing the advantages of this technique, such as a range of 0-1. However, I'm also scrutinizing its implications, especially the context-dependent nature and the potential for compression of relative differences.


**Analyzing the Logit Implementation**

I'm now deep into the core of the `update_node_turn_probs` method, investigating the logit model's behavior. I realize the sum normalization's effect on utility calculations, specifically its potential to violate the IIA property, making it a context-dependent model. I am weighing the benefits of this choice, and comparing them to other alternatives.


**Assessing Utility Calculation**

I'm now examining the core utility calculation, specifically focusing on the division by the sum of `distances`, `densities`, and `capacities`. I recognize this operation is meant to scale each value, but the chosen method introduces a context-dependent utility. Although a 0-1 range is ensured, it introduces a specific kind of context dependency that could be avoided with other options.


**Reflecting on the Utility Function**

I'm currently analyzing the choice of sum normalization for the utilities in `update_node_turn_probs`. I am weighing the benefits of this normalization, but I'm now more focused on the context dependency and the potential for compressing the relative differences within each component. Moreover, I'm evaluating whether this is an intentional design choice to circumvent the IIA.


**Assessing the Implementation**

I'm now re-examining the initial question, whether the method for normalizing distances, densities, and capacities is ideal. The current approach is to divide each factor by its sum within the utility calculations. I see this approach is a deliberate strategy.


**Delving Into the Logic**

I'm currently investigating the impact of the scaling factors within the context of the logit model. I see the sum normalization's effect is to make relative differences less dramatic, which I'm now evaluating in terms of the model's robustness. I will compare it to simpler alternatives.

Hello! I see you're asking about the normalization method used in the utility calculation. That's a great question. Let's break it down.

The line of code in question is within the `update_node_turn_probs` method in `src/LTM/path_finder.py`:

```python:src/LTM/path_finder.py
// ... existing code ...
                utilities = (self.alpha * np.array(distances)/(np.sum(distances)+1e-6)
                             + self.beta * np.array(densities)/(np.sum(densities)+1e-6)
                             - self.omega * np.array(capacities)/(np.sum(capacities)+1e-6))
// ... existing code ...
```

This utility function calculates the "cost" for taking a certain path from a node. The choice probability is then calculated using a logit model: `exp(-theta * utility)`. A higher utility means a lower probability of choosing that path.

The current implementation normalizes each component (`distances`, `densities`, `capacities`) by dividing by its sum. This is a valid technique that transforms each component into a set of values that sum to 1, making them comparable.

### Analysis of the Current Method

*   **Pros**:
    *   It brings different physical quantities (distance, density, capacity) to a similar scale, so the weights (`alpha`, `beta`, `omega`) are more intuitive to tune.
    *   It's simple to implement and avoids division-by-zero errors when there's only one path choice available.

*   **Cons**:
    *   **Scale Invariance**: The normalized values depend only on the relative differences between choices, not their absolute magnitudes. For example, the normalized distances for path options of `[100, 200]` meters are the same as for `[1000, 2000]` meters. Intuitively, the absolute distance should matter.
    *   **Context Dependency**: The utility of one option is highly dependent on all other available options. Adding a new, very unattractive option (e.g., a very long path) will alter the utilities of all other options, making them appear more similar to each other. This might not be the desired behavior.

### Alternative: Min-Max Scaling

A more standard and often more intuitive approach for this kind of feature scaling is **min-max normalization**:

\[ \text{normalized}(x_i) = \frac{x_i - \min(x)}{\max(x) - \min(x)} \]

This scales all values into a `[0, 1]` range.

*   **Pros of Min-Max**:
    *   The interpretation is clear: the best option gets a value of 0 for that cost component, and the worst gets a 1.
    *   It preserves the relative spacing between values better than the sum-normalization method in some cases.
    *   Like the current method, it is scale-invariant (e.g., `[100, 200]` and `[1000, 1100]` both normalize to `[0, 1]`), which focuses the choice on the local best/worst options.

### Recommendation

While the current method is functional, using **min-max normalization** could make the model's behavior more standard and potentially more robust. It is a very common technique for scaling features before they are combined in a model.

If you'd like, I can implement this change. It would involve creating a helper function for safe min-max scaling (to handle cases where all choices are equal) and then applying it to `distances`, `densities`, and `capacities` before calculating the `utilities`.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

**Analyzing the Question's Nuance**

The user's follow-up is insightful! I'm currently grappling with their question about determining the min-max values for distance calculations. It's crucial for understanding how best to normalize the data, and I'm starting to outline the potential scenarios for different distance metrics.


**Pinpointing Distance Calculation**

I've zeroed in on the core of the user's query, focusing specifically on the `update_node_turn_probs` function. The crucial point is that min/max distance calculations are *context-dependent*. They must be derived from the 'distances' list which represents available downstream paths. I'm considering how to best integrate these bounds within the normalization logic.


**Elaborating on the Scope**

Now, I'm crystallizing the explanation for the user. Specifically, I'm clarifying that min/max values aren't globally fixed. They dynamically adjust based on the `distances` list at each node, representing the available path choices. The normalization logic directly uses the min and max from that particular set of choices (e.g., distances `[d1, d2, d3]`) for any given `up_node`. I'll incorporate a simple code example to illustrate this, addressing the key consideration of local versus global constraints.


**Clarifying Local Scope**

I'm now crafting the explanation regarding the user's query about min-max values. These values are calculated "locally" within the context of the `update_node_turn_probs` function, based on the `distances` list for the available paths. For example, if distances are `[100, 200, 500]`, normalization is performed using `min=100` and `max=500`. I'm also addressing the edge case where min equals max. The next step is implementation.


**Defining the Normalization Logic**

My understanding is solidifying. The core of the issue revolves around specifying how the min/max values are calculated in the `update_node_turn_probs` function, where I am suggesting a local calculation using distances. I'm outlining how to clearly articulate this local scope to the user, along with the necessity of the min-max scaling and a safe approach for the edge case.


**Defining Local Calculation**

I've refined the normalization strategy. The core concept is that min and max are computed *locally* within the context of the `update_node_turn_probs` function. Given `distances` for available downstream paths, such as `[100, 200, 500]`, the min is 100, the max is 500. I'll also include a safe helper function, and propose the implementation update to the code.


**Formulating a Solution**

I'm now detailing the user's question about min-max distance normalization. The core is that the `min` and `max` values are calculated "locally", within the `update_node_turn_probs` function, based on the `distances` from the available paths. For instance, with distances `[100, 200, 500]`, normalization uses `min=100` and `max=500`. I'll address the edge case where min equals max and the user's willingness to implement the update. I'll propose a safe helper function to integrate the normalization.


**Refining Implementation Plan**

I'm now firming up the code changes. The core idea is a local min-max calculation within the `update_node_turn_probs` function, using the `distances` list specific to the available downstream paths. I'll implement a `_min_max_scale` helper to ensure safety and handle cases where the min and max values are the same. After the explanation, I'll provide the code with the update, building on the current `path_finder.py` file.


**Confirming Local Min/Max**

I've formulated the answer regarding the user's question concerning min-max values. The local scope is defined by the `update_node_turn_probs` function, calculated on available `distances` (e.g., `[100, 200, 500]`). This local scope is crucial, using `min=100` and `max=500`. I have included the edge case and propose a solution with a helper function, and then proposed the implementation, as the user requested previously.


**Defining the Solution**

I've addressed the user's question: the `min` and `max` values are calculated "locally," within the `update_node_turn_probs` function, using the available `distances` for downstream paths. For example, if distances are `[100, 200, 500]`, normalization uses `min=100` and `max=500`. I'll handle the `min == max` edge case and proposed the required code changes, integrating a safe helper function, and I am ready to implement the suggested solution.


**Implementing Min-Max Scaling**

I've finalized the implementation, using local min-max calculations, addressing edge cases with a helper function, and I'm ready to present the updated code to the user.


**Formulating the Solution**

I'm now ready to address the user's query regarding min-max distance normalization. The core concept revolves around calculating the `min` and `max` values "locally," within the `update_node_turn_probs` function, drawing from the `distances` list specific to available downstream paths. If distances are `[100, 200, 500]`, normalization will use `min=100` and `max=500`. I'll handle the edge case where `min == max`, and then propose the solution including a helper function and the implementation.


**Finalizing the Code**

I've implemented the suggested changes by introducing local min-max calculations using a safe helper function in the `update_node_turn_probs` function. Now, I'm ready to share the updated code, incorporating the scaling and handling the edge case where min and max are equal.


**Implementing the Code Change**

I've implemented the changes, which include calculating the min and max *locally* within the `update_node_turn_probs` function and adding a safety check. The user is asking how we can know the min/max value for the distance. I provided a concrete example (distances `[50, 120, 150]`), then I implemented the proposed code. Here is the final result with the min-max scaling and added safety.


**Addressing the Implementation**

I've carefully reviewed the user's inquiry, recognizing their interest in min-max normalization. The core understanding is clear: the `min` and `max` values are computed "locally," within the `update_node_turn_probs` function, using the `distances` list for the available downstream paths. For example, if the distances are `[50, 120, 150]`, then the calculation will use `min=50` and `max=150`. I have the updated code ready, and I'm prepared to share the implementation.

You've hit on a key point. That's an excellent question.

The `min` and `max` values are not global constants for the entire network. They are determined dynamically from the set of available choices at each specific decision point.

Here's how it works:

1.  When the simulation is at a specific node, it considers all possible downstream links a pedestrian can take to continue toward their destination.
2.  The `distances` list contains the total remaining path length for each of these possible turns.
3.  We calculate the `min` and `max` values directly from *that list* of distances.

For example, if from your current node there are three turns leading to paths with remaining distances of `[100, 200, 500]`, we would use `min=100` and `max=500` to normalize only those three values. The same logic applies to `densities` and `capacities`.

This "local" scaling ensures that the choice is always relative to the immediate options available.

I'll also build in protection for the case where all options are equal (e.g., all distances are the same), which would make `max - min` zero. In that scenario, the scaled value for all options will be 0, correctly indicating no preference based on that attribute.

I will now apply this min-max scaling method. I'll add a helper function to the `PathFinder` class and then use it to update the utility calculation.

Here are the changes for `src/LTM/path_finder.py`:

```python:src/LTM/path_finder.py
// ... existing code ...
    def update_turning_fractions(self, node, time_step: int, od_manager):
// ... existing code ...
        # current_node.turns_in_ods = turns_od_dict
        # store the turns for the node
        # return turns_od_dict

    @staticmethod
    def _min_max_scale(x):
        """Safely scale a numpy array to [0, 1] range."""
        x = np.array(x, dtype=float)
        min_val = np.min(x)
        max_val = np.max(x)
        # Add a small epsilon for floating point comparison
        if max_val - min_val > 1e-9:
            return (x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
        # If all values are the same, their contribution to utility should be uniform,
        # and since lower utility is better, 0 is a good choice.
        return np.zeros_like(x)

    def update_node_turn_probs(self, node, od_pair, time_step):

        #     pass
        for up_node, down_nodes in node.turns_distances[od_pair].items():
            if down_nodes:
                turns = list((up_node, down_node) for down_node in down_nodes)
                distances = list(down_nodes.values())
                # num_pedestrians = []
                densities = []
                capacities = []
                for down_node in down_nodes:
                    try:
                        link = self.links[(node.node_id, down_node)]
                        # num_pedestrians.append(self.links[(node.node_id, down_node)].num_pedestrians[time_step-1]) # use the previous time step, current time step is not available is not updated yet
                        densities.append(link.density[time_step-1])
                        capacity = link.receiving_flow[time_step-1]
                        capacities.append(capacity if capacity > 0 else link.back_gate_width * link.free_flow_speed * link.k_critical)
                    except KeyError:
                        densities.append(0)
                        capacities.append(30) # set a high capacity for origin/destination nodes

                # Normalize features using min-max scaling
                norm_distances = self._min_max_scale(distances)
                norm_densities = self._min_max_scale(densities)
                norm_capacities = self._min_max_scale(capacities)

                utilities = (self.alpha * norm_distances
                             + self.beta * norm_densities
                             - self.omega * norm_capacities)

                exp_utilities = np.exp(-self.theta * utilities)
                probs = exp_utilities / (np.sum(exp_utilities) + 1e-9)
                node.node_turn_probs[od_pair].update(dict(zip(turns, probs)))
        
        return node.node_turn_probs
    
    def update_turning_fractions(self, node, time_step: int, od_manager):
// ... existing code ...
```

I've added the `_min_max_scale` static method and updated `update_node_turn_probs` to use it for calculating the utilities. This should provide a more robust and standard way of normalizing the different factors in the route choice model.
